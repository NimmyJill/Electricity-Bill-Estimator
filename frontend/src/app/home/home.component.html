<h5>Power bills during COVID-19 lockdown come as rude shock to consumers in Kerala</h5>
<p>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Consumers are at the receiving end after metre reading by
     Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) resumed from March. 
    They complained that the bill amount has shoot up causing additional financial burden to them.</p>
<p>Ever since the countrywide lockdown was announced on March 24, Malayalis have been staying indoors.</p>
<p>This had resulted in an increase in power consumption much to the happiness of KSEB officials.
     But this has not gone down well with consumers ever since the metre reading resumed.</p>
<p>Majority of the domestic consumers received a rude jolt when they realised that 
    their monthly/bi-monthly charges have increased manifold. The respective KSEB electrical section 
    offices are facing a deluge of phone calls from consumers citing discrepancy in the bill generated.</p>
<p>EB explains that the computer-generated billing system is set in such a way that it is taken 
    either monthly or bi-monthly. 
    But this time, the computerised bill has been generated after 65 days to 67 days.

    “So, there has been a jump in the slab rates when it should have been generated on the 30th day or on the 60th day. 
    If earlier, 300 units were consumed, then it would have been calculated at the rate of Rs 5.80/unit,
     the next slab of 301 at Rs 6.60/unit, the 400 slab rate at Rs 6.90/unit and 
     above 500 slab rate at Rs 7.10/unit.
     Not a single consumer will be penalised by EB.
      If there has been an increase or decrease in the bill amount,
       it will be adjusted accordingly in the subsequent bills,” said the Director.</p>
       <p>He urged the consumers to approach their respective electrical section offices
            and lodge a complaint in writing if they feel that there is any discrepancy in their bill. 
            In certain areas, the average bill based on the last three bills was generated, 
            especially for commercial establishments. Except medical stores and grocery stores,
             the remaining shops had been shut since March 20 in Kerala which adversely impacted the board.
            They were asked to pay 70 per cent of their last bill.</p>
