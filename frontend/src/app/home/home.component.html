          Power bills during COVID-19 lockdown come as rude shock to consumers
          in Kerala
        </h5>
        <p>
          THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Consumers are at the receiving end after metre
          reading by Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) resumed from March.
          They complained that the bill amount has shoot up causing additional
          financial burden to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the countrywide lockdown was announced on March 24,
          Malayalis have been staying indoors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This had resulted in an increase in power consumption much to the
          happiness of KSEB officials. But this has not gone down well with
          consumers ever since the metre reading resumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Majority of the domestic consumers received a rude jolt when they
          realised that their monthly/bi-monthly charges have increased
          manifold. The respective KSEB electrical section offices are facing a
          deluge of phone calls from consumers citing discrepancy in the bill
          generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          EB explains that the computer-generated billing system is set in such
          a way that it is taken either monthly or bi-monthly. But this time,
          the computerised bill has been generated after 65 days to 67 days.
          “So, there has been a jump in the slab rates when it should have been
          generated on the 30th day or on the 60th day. If earlier, 300 units
          were consumed, then it would have been calculated at the rate of Rs
          5.80/unit, the next slab of 301 at Rs 6.60/unit, the 400 slab rate at
          Rs 6.90/unit and above 500 slab rate at Rs 7.10/unit. Not a single
          consumer will be penalised by EB. If there has been an increase or
          decrease in the bill amount, it will be adjusted accordingly in the
          subsequent bills,” said the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          He urged the consumers to approach their respective electrical section
          offices and lodge a complaint in writing if they feel that there is
          any discrepancy in their bill. In certain areas, the average bill
          based on the last three bills was generated, especially for commercial
          establishments. Except medical stores and grocery stores, the
          remaining shops had been shut since March 20 in Kerala which adversely
          impacted the board. They were asked to pay 70 per cent of their last
          bill.

        <h5>Need for a Self-service Electricity Bill Estimator:</h5>
        <p>
          With the help of a Self-service Electricity Bill Estimator, bill
          amount can be easily estimated.

                <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">
                  Energy Meter or Watt-Hour Meter is an electrical instrument
                  that measures the amount of electrical energy used by the
                  consumers. Utilities are one of the electrical departments,
                  which install these instruments at every place like homes,
                  industries, organizations, commercial buildings to charge for
                  the electricity consumption by loads such as lights, fans,
                  refrigerator, and other home appliances. The basic unit of
                  power is watts and it is measured by using a watt meter. One
                  thousand watts make one kilowatt. If one uses one kilowatt in
                  one-hour duration, one unit of energy gets consumed. So energy
                  meters measure the rapid voltage and currents, calculate their
                  product and give instantaneous power.

                  In the single phase energy meter you can see various readings
                  like voltage,power factor,ampere,kVA,kWh ..etc.The reading in
                  which kWh is seen on the right bottom side of meter display
                  indicates our usage of electricity. The difference between the
                  this readings in specified time interval is our consumption.
                  Here consumption=kWH=T1kWh+T2kWh+T3kWh Where T1, T2 and T3 are
                  different times of the day(TOD). In a three phase connection
                  we can find the readings of all the three phases.The reading
                  CkWh(Cumulative Kilowatt Hour)in right bottom side of the
                  display shows our total consumed unit of energy. Here

                <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">
                  If you are looking for the KSEB electricity bill tariff rates
                  and slab system, you are in the right place. Find out how your
                  electricity bill is calculated and how the telescopic slab
                  system works. The Kerala State Electricity Boards (KSEB) has
                  revised Electricity Tariff for domestic users in Kerala. The
                  new tariff is applicable from August 16, 2014. The Kerala
                  State Electricity Regulatory Commission is governing authority
                  of Government of Kerala to look after power supply,
                  consumption and related issues in the state. The domestic
                  consumers using less than 40 units a month are exempted from
                  tariff hike. The power subsidy is available to BPL families
                  only.

                <h4 class="card-title">What is telescopic billing?</h4>
                <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">
                  KSEB follows a slab system for electricity billing. According
                  to this slab system, there are different rates applied for
                  different slabs of electricity consumption. As you move up in
                  the slabs, the rate per unit goes up significantly. You will
                  be billed different rates for the units consumed according to
                  the slabs. This is called telescopic billing. Under the new
                  arrangement, KSEB follows a Slab System to bill consumers. For
                  the first 40 units who come under the BPL Category Candidates
                  with connected load 1000 watts or below, the rate is Rs 1.50
                  per unit. Even for BPL category, if the monthly consumption
                  goes above 40 units, the following general rates are
                  applicable for BPL category as well.
